1: Take two Heap(1 Min Heap and 1 Max Heap)
   Max Heap will contain first half number of elements
   Min Heap will contain second half number of elements

2: Compare new number from stream with top of Max Heap, 
   if it is smaller or equal add that number in max heap. 
   Otherwise add number in Min Heap.

3: if min Heap has more elements than Max Heap 
   then remove top element of Min Heap and add in Max Heap.
   if max Heap has more than one element than in Min Heap 
   then remove top element of Max Heap and add in Min Heap.

4: If Both heaps has equal number of elements then
   median will be half of sum of max element from Max Heap and min element from Min Heap.
   Otherwise median will be max element from the first partition.
